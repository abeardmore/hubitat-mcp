Expose **Hubitat Maker API devices** to an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server so AI assistants like Claude Desktop can control your smart home.

It uses the [Hubitat Maker API](https://docs.hubitat.com/index.php?title=Maker_API) for device access and integrates with the [mcp-proxy](https://github.com/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy) project.

---

## Features
- Lists Hubitat devices and their attributes
- Sends on/off and custom commands to devices
- Works with MCP-compatible assistants (Claude Desktop, etc.)
- Supports **local** or **cloud** Maker API URLs

---

## Prerequisites
1. **Hubitat Hub** with [Maker API app](https://docs.hubitat.com/index.php?title=Maker_API) installed.
2. Your **Maker API App ID** and **Access Token**.
3. Python 3.10+ installed.
4. MCP Proxy installed â€” [mcp-proxy GitHub repo](https://github.com/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy).

---

## Local vs Cloud URLs

**Local URL (recommended for speed)**:
```
http://<HUBITAT_LOCAL_IP>/apps/api/<APP_ID>/devices
```

**Cloud URL (slower, works remotely)**:
```
https://cloud.hubitat.com/api/<CLOUD_ID>/apps/<APP_ID>/devices
```

---

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abeardmore/hubitat-mcp.git
cd hubitat-mcp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Configuration
Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set:
```bash
HUBITAT_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.50/apps/api/<APP_ID>/devices
HUBITAT_TOKEN=<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

---

## Running the Server
```bash
python hubitat_mcp_server.py
```

---

## Claude Desktop Integration

Add the following to your **`claude_desktop_config.json`** file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hubitat": {
      "command": "mcp-proxy",
      "args": ["http://localhost:5005"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Your Hubitat devices should now be discoverable and controllable.

## Usage Ideas

Once your MCP server is running and Claude Desktop is connected, you can ask Claude to perform actions or retrieve information from your Hubitat setup.

### Control Devices
Ask Claude to turn things on/off or change settings.
```
Turn on the Office Corner Lamp.
Set the Living Room Light to 30% brightness.
Turn off all lights in the Office.
```

### List Devices
Get a list of all available devices.
```
List my Hubitat devices.
```

### Check Device Status
Ask for current state or attribute values.
```
What is the temperature in the Living Room?
Is the Garage Door open or closed?
Show me the battery level of all my sensors.
```

### Get Insights
Analyze smart home data.
```
Which lights have been on the longest today?
Show me devices that haven't responded in the past 24 hours.
Summarize my motion sensor activity for today.
```

### Automations & Routines
Design routines and automations.
```
Create a morning routine that turns on the kitchen lights, starts the coffee maker, and sets the thermostat to 72Â°F.
Help me make a bedtime routine that turns off all lights and locks the doors.
```

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Claude can chain actions together and help design complex automations for Hubitat or MCP.
